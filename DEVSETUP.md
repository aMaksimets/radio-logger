# Development Setup Guide

This guide is for the people that would like to contribute to radio-logger.

While we use VSCode and Visual Studio 2019, you can use whatever IDE or editor you prefer.

Please have a read on [CODESTYLE.md](CODESTYLE.md), any code that does not apply to these rules will not get merged.

## General

This section is for all IDE's not mentioned in this guide.
It's very global, so you might need to take some extra steps to get it to work for you.

1. Fork the [radio-logger repository](https://github.com/gbowne1/radio-logger).
2. Check out your fork and open it in your favorite IDE or editor
3. If your favorite IDE is not below, please add your workspace and or project configuration settings to this project.

Install Prettier 2.5 or 2.6.x, ESLint v8.6, Babel v7 and any of their plugins for REACT.

## Review Process

The maintainers will review the submission via Pull Request and determine whether the changes and will work.

## VSCode

The .vscode folder includes project, workspace and settings files.

DONE! Happy coding! :smiley:
